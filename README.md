# Simon Game
Built by **_Nicolas Truel_**

---
> Inspired by the Simon game, an electronic game of memory skill, invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison in 1978. The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails, the game is over.

## UX
> The main goal of this project is to produce a functional game with Javascript, as well as utilising the ealier skills learned such as HTML and CSS.
