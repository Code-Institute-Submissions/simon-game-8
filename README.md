# Simon Game
Built by **_Nicolas Truel_**

---
> Inspired by the __Simon game__, an electronic game of memory skill, invented by _Ralph H. Baer_ and _Howard J. Morrison_ in 1978. The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails, the game is over.

## UX
> The goal of this project is to produce a functional game with _Javascript_, as well as utilising the ealier skills learned such as _HTML_ and _CSS_.

> The user should be able to enjoy the game on any device. The contrast between the colors of the pad should be clear and the sounds associated to each color will help the user remember the series proposed by the computer.

## Features

* The game has a "Rules" button explaining to the user how to play the game.
* A "Press to start" button acts as an on switch, and start the first serie.
* The "Game Pad" is composed of 4 different colored buttons with a different sound each.
* Each button has three different shades of colors. The dim one is set when the game is off (before the user clicks on the start button). The brighter one is set when the game is on-going. And the brightest one is activated when the button is pressed (either by the computer or the user).
* The first serie generates one color with its sound.
* The user is asked to copy the computer output by pressing the same button.
* If the user input is correct, the same sequence is regenerated by the computer, and another step of "color and sound" is added.
* If the user input is wrong, a sound is generated annoucing to the user the game is over.(The choice of re-starting a game is proposed)
* The game is won when the user completes 10 rounds without mistake.
* Below the Game Pad, the number of rounds played is displayed as well as a "Try Again" message if the user inputs the wrong color, and a winning message when the user finishes the game.
* During play, the "Press to start" button displays "Playing".

___
A strict version of the game will be added shortly, enabling the user to re-start at the previous round when inputing a wrong answer (As opposed to restarting from round 1 at the moment).
