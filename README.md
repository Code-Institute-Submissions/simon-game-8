# Simon Game
Built by **_Nicolas Truel_**

---
> Inspired by the Simon game, an electronic game of memory skill, invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison in 1978. The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails, the game is over.

## UX
> The goal of this project is to produce a functional game with Javascript, as well as utilising the ealier skills learned such as HTML and CSS.

* The game has a "Rules" button explaining to the user how to play the game.
* A "Start" button acts as an on switch, and start the first serie.
* The "Game Pad" is composed of 4 different colored buttons with a different sound each.
* The first serie generates one color with its sound.
* The user is asked to copy the computer output by pressing the same button.
* If the user input is correct, the same sequence is regenerated by the computer, and another step of "color and sound" is added.
* If the user input is wrong, a sound is generated annoucing to the user the game is over.(The choice of re-starting a game is proposed)
* The game is won when the user completes 10 rounds without mistake.
* Below the Game Pad, the number of rounds played is displayed as well as a "Try Again" message if the user inputs the wrong color, and a winning message in the case of the user finishing the game.
